# An exception to PEP 8 is our rules on line lengths. Donâ€™t limit lines of 
# code to 79 characters if it means the code looks significantly uglier or
# is harder to read. We allow up to 119 characters as this is the width of 
# GitHub code review; anything longer requires horizontal scrolling which 
# makes review more difficult. This check is included when you run flake8. 
# Documentation, comments, and docstrings should be wrapped at 79 characters,
# even though PEP 8 suggests 72.
